# Project-1-Analysing-Phishing-Emails
Analyse the Body of the Email

Spot The Red Flags in the Email Body:

Goal is to identified any red flags for each bullet point.


1) Unfamiliar sender or email address: The email is from someone you don't recognise, or the domain is slightly misspelt (e.g., "support@paypa1.com" instead of "support@paypal.com").
2) Urgent or alarming language: The email pressures you to act immediately, often threatening consequences if you don’t.
3) Suspicious attachments or links: Unexpected attachments or links that request sensitive information or lead to unfamiliar websites.
4) Generic greetings: Using broad salutations like "Dear Customer" instead of addressing you by name.
5) Spelling and grammar mistakes: Phishing emails often contain poor grammar, awkward language, or spelling errors.
6) Request for personal or financial information: Asking for passwords, credit card numbers, or other sensitive information.
7) Mismatch between display name and email address: The name shown in the email may not match the actual email address.
8) Inconsistent or suspicious URLs: Hover over links without clicking to check if the destination URL matches the claimed website.
9) Unexpected request for payment: An email asking for payment for a service you don't recognise or weren't expecting.
10) Too good to be true offers: Promises of large rewards, cash prizes, or free gifts that seem unrealistic.
11) Unfamiliar or odd attachments: Unexpected file attachments, especially if they have unusual extensions like .exe, .zip, or .rar.
12) Lack of company branding: Legitimate companies typically include professional logos, branding, and consistent formatting.
13) Unusual sender’s email domain: The email might come from a suspicious or untrusted domain, rather than an official company email (e.g., "info@gmail.com" instead of "support@company.com").
14) No signature or contact information: Legitimate companies usually include proper signatures and contact details at the end of their emails.
